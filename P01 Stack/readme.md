## Introduction

A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle. It means the last element added to the stack is the first one to be removed. Stacks are widely used in various applications like expression evaluation, backtracking algorithms, and function call management.

## What is a Stack?

A stack is an abstract data type that serves as a collection of elements, with two principal operations:

- **Push**: Adds an element to the top of the stack.
- **Pop**: Removes the element from the top of the stack.

Additional operations include:

- **Peek/Top**: Returns the top element without removing it.
- **IsEmpty**: Checks if the stack is empty.

## Operations

Here are the primary operations associated with a stack:

1. **Push**(element)
2. **Pop**()
3. **Peek**()
4. **Travel**()

## Implementations

This repository contains implementations of stack data structures in C Language

Feel free to explore the respective folders for detailed implementations and examples.

## Applications

Stacks have numerous applications, including:

- Expression parsing (infix, postfix, prefix)
- Backtracking algorithms (like maze solving)
- Undo mechanisms in software applications
- Syntax checking in compilers
