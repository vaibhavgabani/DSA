# Data Structures Assignment 2

## BSc I.T. 3rd Semester - Practical

This repository contains the solutions to the second Data Structures assignment, which focuses on various queue implementations in C. Each task corresponds to a specific type of queue, implemented using appropriate data structures.

## Assignment Tasks

1. **Simple Queue Operations:**
   - Write a program to perform all operations (enqueue, dequeue, etc.) on a simple queue.

2. **Circular Queue:**
   - Write a program to implement a circular queue.

3. **Queue as Stack:**
   - Write a program to implement a queue that works as a stack.

4. **Input-Restricted Double-Ended Queue:**
   - Implement an input-restricted double-ended queue (deque) where input is restricted to one end.

5. **Reversed Queue:**
   - Write a program to implement a queue by reversing the front and rear pointers.

6. **Queue with Pointer:**
   - Write a program to implement a queue with an integer pointer.

7. **Multiple Priority Queue (Simple Queue):**
   - Implement a multiple-priority queue with two priority queues, both using simple queue operations.

8. **Priority Queue with Structure:**
   - Write a program to implement a priority queue using a structure. One of the structure members should be the priority number.
